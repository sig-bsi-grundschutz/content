title: 'Ensure every MachineConfigPool consists of more than one node'

description: |- 
    To ensure, that workloads are able to be provisioned highly available, every node role should
    consist of more than one node. This enables workloads to be scheduled across multiple nodes and
    stay available in case one node of a role is unavailable. Different node roles may exist to isolate
    control plane, infrastructure and application workload. There might be additional use cases to 
    create additional node roles for further isolation.

    To ensure, that workloads are able to be provisioned highly available, every node role should
    consist of more than one node. This enables workloads to be scheduled across multiple nodes and
    stay available in case one node of a role is unavailable.
