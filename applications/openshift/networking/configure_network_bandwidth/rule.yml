title: 'Limiting Network Bandwidth in Pods'

description: |-
    Network bandwidth, SHOULD be appropriately reserved and limited.

rationale: |-
    Network bandwidth is limited at the pod level and can be determined separately according
    to incoming and outgoing network bandwidth.
    For more information about limiting Pod bandwidth on OCP 4 please refer to the Red Hat documentation:
    {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5018951") }}}

    Out of the documetation use the example for the network bandwidth configuration of a pod: 
    <pre>
    kind: Pod
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: hello-openshift
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth: 2M
        kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth: 1M
    spec:
        containers:
          - image: openshift/hello-openshift
            name: hello-openshift
    </pre>
