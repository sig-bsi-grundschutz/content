title: 'Ensure appropriate Network Policies are configured'

description: |-
  Configure Network Policies in any application namespace in an approrpriate way, so that
  only the required communications are allowed. The Network Policies should precisely define
  source and target using label selectors and ports.

rationale: |-
  By default, all pod to pod traffic within a cluster is allowed. Network
  Policy creates a pod- level firewall that can be used to restrict traffic
  between sources. Pod traffic is restricted by having a Network Policy that
  selects it (through the use of labels). Once there is any Network Policy in a
  namespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections
  that are not allowed by any Network Policy. Other pods in the namespace that
  are not selected by any Network Policy will continue to accept all traffic.

  Implementing Kubernetes Network Policies with minimal allowed communication enhances security
  by reducing entry points and limiting attacker movement within the cluster. It ensures pods and
  services communicate only with necessary entities, reducing unauthorized access risks. In case
  of a breach, these policies contain compromised pods, preventing widespread malicious activity.
  Additionally, they enhance monitoring and detection of anomalous network activities.

ocil: |-
    For each non-default namespace in the cluster, review the configured Network Policies
    and ensure that they only allow the necessary network network connections. They should should
    precisely define source and target using label selectors and ports.

    1. Get a list of existing projects(namespaces), exclude default, kube-*, openshift-*
    <pre>$ oc get namespaces -ojson | jq -r '[.items[] | select((.metadata.name | startswith("openshift") | not) and (.metadata.name | startswith("kube-") | not) and .metadata.name != "default") | .metadata.name]'</pre>

    2. For each of these namespaces, review the network policies:
    <pre>$ oc get networkpolicies -n $namespace -o yaml</pre>
